This project, developed utilizing Python in conjunction with yfinance, functions by ingesting a .csv file containing stock data and subsequently formulating the most high-risk portfolio from the provided stocks. The selection process involves assessing stocks according to their standard deviation of close price percent change, mean correlation, and moving mean. Upon identifying the combination of the top 10 riskiest stocks, the project executes a Monte Carlo simulation to determine optimal weightings, culminating in the generation of a CSV file that details the selected stocks alongside their respective weightings
